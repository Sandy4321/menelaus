Covers years 2007 through 2021, each year has 20,000 observations
Items B, E, and F are normally distributed, all others are gamma

Drift 1 (2009): Item B changes in mean but not variance
Drift 2 (2012): Item D changes in just variance (mean stays same)
Drift 3 (2015): Item E and F become more strongly correlated. Their mean and variance stay the same
Drift 4 (2018 - 2021): Item H changes in mean and variance
Drift 5 (2021): Item J change mean and variance 

With the except of drift 4, all instances of drift are only for that single year of data.

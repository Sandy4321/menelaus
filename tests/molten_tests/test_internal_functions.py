""" Making an example file. These functions may test internal common portions of the code.
    Examples include:
    - Does LLH work as intended (can try on tiny list rather than realistic one)
    - Does the general flow of a Detector work correctly (e.g., what happens when drift is detected, etc.)
    In general this is left about the detectors detecting and more about them working. 
    Also I needed a new file to test changes in the VM GitLab Runner.
